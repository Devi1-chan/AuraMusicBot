# AuraMusicBot

> I cloned Lara Music Bot while gooning

Why pay **$3.5/month** for Lara(prob have censorships too), when you can **burn $30 in electricity** and run it on ur pc?

This bot is legally distinct btw (my code better).

## Features

- YouTube playback (it steals it from youtube using ur own cookies)
- Loop & Playlist Loop
- Pause, Skip, Previous track
- Show current queue
- Built with gooning in mind

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (bc i have it installed)
- `ffmpeg.exe` (auto-downloaded, u might need to change path if u installed it on ur own)
- Internet, duh
- and whatever runs python 3.9+

## Setup

Clone this repo, then double click `start-aura-music.bat`. It installs everything and starts the bot.

put the cookie with the bot, also token or whatever discord needs.
